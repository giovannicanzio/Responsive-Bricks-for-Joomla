# Responsive Bricks for Joomla 0.1

## About

Responsive Bricks for Joomla is a Joomla theme based on Skeleton framework (written by Dave Gamache, http://www.getskeleton.com/)
It follows a responsive design logic, gives back a valid HTML5 output (except some attributes like 'about' and 'type' that Drupal adds dinamically for its own purposes).
Any contribution will be very appreciated.
Please feel free to contact me for any question/info request/suggestion.
And please let me know if you use this basic template for more graphically complex themes, I'll be glad to spread your work!
